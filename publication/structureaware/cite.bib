abstract = {In recent years, the image inpainting technology based on deep learning has made remarkable
progress, which can better complete the complex image inpainting task compared with
traditional methods. However, most of the existing methods can not generate reasonable
structure and fine texture details at the same time. To solve this problem, in this
paper we propose a two-stage image inpainting method with structure awareness based
on Generative Adversarial Networks, which divides the inpainting process into two
sub tasks, namely, image structure generation and image content generation. In the
former stage, the network generates the structural information of the missing area;
while in the latter stage, the network uses this structural information as a prior,
and combines the existing texture and color information to complete the image. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method on Places2,
CelebA and Paris Streetview datasets. The experimental results show the superior performance
of the proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively
and quantitatively.},
